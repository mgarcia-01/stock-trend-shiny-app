\title{Stock Trend App}

\description{This app provides two charts: The first plots the daily price changes as a percent.
            The second plots the daily closing price and plots simple moving average. The charts are 
            interactive and can select a range of dates. The SMA can be changed to a number between 1
            and 365.
            
            Notes: If there are less obeservations than there are number of days, it will cause an 
            error.
            
            For this project, the dataset is included. For live data pull, you require your own key
            from the vendor.}
